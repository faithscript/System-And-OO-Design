What is the difference between activity diagram and sequence diagram?

AD - captures the process flow. Used for funuctional modeling. A functional model reps the flow of values from external inputs,  through operations and 
     internal data stores, to external outputs
     
SD - tracks the interaction between objects. It is used for dynamic modeling, which is represented by tracking states, transitions between states, and the events that
     trigger the transitions.
